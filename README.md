## Data

I used Python Jupyter Notebook to combine 8 excel files worth of data into 1 easy to work with file.  I then converted the trip durations from seconds to minutes to make the times more eye friendly to read. I added a column for the Ride ID to identify each rider and then I dropped all rows where the user's age was over 90.
