# Citi-Bike-Tableau-Analytics

## January 2019 - August 2019

# Objective

Analyze and visualize Citibike data from January 2019 to August 2019 for trends using Tableau Public.  You may view the Tableau Public workbook https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/megan.butler1396

## Data

I used Python Jupyter Notebook to combine 8 excel files worth of data into 1 easy to work with file.  I then converted the trip durations from seconds to minutes to make the times more eye friendly to read. I added a column for the Ride ID to identify each rider and then I dropped all rows where the user's age was over 90.

## Analysis

My first analysis was a chart displaying the Average Monthly Number of Trips by Gender.  Overall, female riders were on average the greater amount of users overall with the higher average trip duration.  I can conclude that most of the daily customers did not report gender,  thus we have a greater unknown percentage.

This next chart broke down the Average Duration of the Trips by Age and Usertype.  The greatest amout a mileage was performed by customers with the ages ranging between 65-90. The subscribers were at a steady rate in the 7-8 mile across all ages.  I would make an assumption that the majority of users were retired and thus had more time to travel the city by bike on thier leisure. Also, most customers would choose the freedom to simply rent daily rather then to subscribe to have the freedom to choose when they wanted without being tied to a contract.

My analysis of the average number of riders showed the greater trend of subscribers riding between the morning hours of 7-8a.m. and between 5-6p.m.  This would indicate that subscribers used bikes as a means of transportation most likely to and from work places.  Also, in the summer hours, it is easier for retired elders that have an overall tendency to ride for exercise in the early hours.

The winter were between 7-8a.m. with the vast majority of the users being subscribers.  There was a significant drop in the number of daily customers compared to the summer hours.  I would assume most customers sought other means of transportation in the colder months, and elder users did not ride out of fear of health conditions.

The graph below shows the duration and trip distances by age.   The most amount of riders overall were between the ages of 26 to 50 on the subscriber basis. The 3rd chart concludes that average customers trip distance was 30% higher than the average subscribers distance.  This would conclude that the majority of the daily riders could be tourists, thus having greater mileage on a daily basis.
